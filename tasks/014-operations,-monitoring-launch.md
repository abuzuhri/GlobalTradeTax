- **Status:** not-started
- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** Unassigned
- **Dependencies:** Review related tasks in [master register](../TASKS.md) before starting.
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-11-02

## Objective
Add metrics, alerts, backups, runbooks, SLOs, incident handling and merchant onboarding.

## Existing project references
compose.yaml; Dockerfile

## Detailed checklist
- [ ] Inspect existing code and identify gaps against objective.
- [ ] Confirm authoritative specifications, data rights, and versioned external contracts where relevant.
- [ ] Implement minimal, isolated C# changes with explicit error handling and fail-closed behavior.
- [ ] Add unit tests for success, missing data, invalid input, and failure modes.
- [ ] Add integration/contract tests where dependencies are involved.
- [ ] Update API documentation, source attribution and configuration examples.
- [ ] Record test commands, outcomes and evidence in the task log.
- [ ] Review security, tenant isolation and backward compatibility.
